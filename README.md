DEX2XML
=======

dex2xml is a Python script to convert DEXonline database to xml format for creating a MOBI dictionary.

Due to Kindle fonts, the diacritics for Romanian language are not displayed properly. (Romanian standard defines diacritics as letters with comma (,) and Kindle displays these with cedilla). Due to this problem, searching for terms containing diacritics with comma would not return any result. This was overcome by exporting terms and inflected forms both with comma and with cedilla.

Tested with Kindle Paperwhite 2013 and Kindle Keyboard 2010

This python script is based on tab2opf.py by Klokan Petr PÃ¸idal (www.klokan.cz)

The regular expressions used for formatting definitions are adapted from:
- https://github.com/dexonline/dexonline/blob/master/lib/Constant.php#L68
- https://wiki.dexonline.ro/wiki/Ghidul_voluntarului

Requirements:
-------------
* Linux or Windows enivronment
* MySQL server
* copy of DEXonline database - download and installation instructions: http://wiki.dexonline.ro/wiki/Instruc%C8%9Biuni_de_instalare
* Python (this script was tested using Python 3.10)
* PyMySql package (compiled from sources or installed using "pip install pymysql")
* _optional_: kindlegen for generating MOBI format (available for Linux/Windows/Mac at http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)

Workflow:
---------
* The `Deploy` workflow from the Github Actions section of the repo can also be used to create the .mobi dictionary. This has the advantage of not requiring to install anything. You can find the generated file(s) in the "artifacts" section of a succesful build.
